# munros

A Flutter package for filtering and sorting Scottish Munro data from  [http://www.hills-database.co.uk/munrotab_v6.2.csv](http://www.hills-database.co.uk/munrotab_v6.2.csv).

The data is bundled with the package, therefore it can be used fully offline.

## Usage

The API consists of a single function to retrieve the data.

```dart
import 'package:munros/munros.dart';

final munros = await getMunros();
```

You can optionally filter, sort and limit the number of results, as described below.

#### Filtering

Apply any number of filters. You can use the provided `MunroFilter`:

```dart
final munros = await getMunros(
  filterBy: [
		MunroFilter.heightMeters(min: 900, max: 1100),
	  MunroFilter.category(HillCategory.munro),
	],
);
```

Alternatively, you can create and apply your own:

```dart
final selectBen = (Munro munro) => munro.name.toLowerCase().contains('ben');

final munros = await getMunros(filterBy: [selectBen]);
```

#### Sorting

Sort by any number of criteria. The sorting will be applied in the order that you specify in the list. For example, to sort by descending height and then by name alphabetically, you could use the provided `MunroComparator` like so:

```dart
final munros = await getMunros(
	sortBy: [
		MunroComparator.heightMetersDescending(),
		MunroComparator.nameAtoZ(),
	],
);
```

If a built-in `Comparator` does not meet your needs, you can define your own like so:

```dart
bool compareGridRefAtoZ(Munro a, Munro b) {
  return a.gridReference.compareTo(b.gridReference);
}

final munros = await getMunros(sortBy: [compareGridRefAtoZ]);
```

#### Limiting the number of results

Specify the maximum number of results to retrieve.

```dart
final munros = await getMunros(maxResults: 15);
```
